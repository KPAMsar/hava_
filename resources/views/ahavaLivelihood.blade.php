                        Livelihood and Social Mobility program is a social reform promoter
                        focused on creating sustainable livelihood for underprivileged people through sharing simple
                        acts
                        of love by providing basic life essentials, learning opportunities beyond formal education and
                        enhanced participation in productive activities. We aim at guiding daily human actions of
                        generosity as well as connecting the rich and poor to live more closely together in a
                        codependent
                        society.
