                         Our initiative seeks to adopt the Peacebuilding, Conflict prevention
                          and preventive diplomacy model which undertakes activities that vary from 
                          broad and long-term, to targeted and short-term, and can be employed simultaneously. Our 
                          preventive work is to 
                          urge restraint and facilitate the de-escalation that paves the way for reconciliation. We are 
                          focused on stabilising 
                          the situations in conflict-sensitive areas, improving inter-ethnic relations, building trust 
                          between the communities, and facilitating access to justice. Focusing on peacebuilding and livelihoods
                           in the hardest hit conflict areas, the programme will reduce tensions and avert further violent incidents 
                           in the local communities, strengthening the 
                          capacity of local authorities,  other civil society organizations, including women organizations, to design 
                          social policies and advocate for their communities.
