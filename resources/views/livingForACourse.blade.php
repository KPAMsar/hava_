                        Dear Friends,<br><br>
                        I’m writing this with so much excitement. Firstly, I just wanted to check in with you and would
                        love to know how you are doing. Hoping you are taking time out from the crazy schedules to check
                        in with yourself. 2022 has been a great year so far, God has kept us alive and if I am being
                        honest
                        this is the year I have been favored to enjoy more of God’s grace and mercy. I mean some moments
                        were all in one exhausting, confusing and overwhelming but we live to fight
                        another day. Therefore, through the extreme high moments and desperately low times I fought to
                        guard
                        my heart, words and thoughts.
                        <br><br>
                        So here is the real gist, every year, I typically have one event or the other
                        to celebrate my birthday. For instance, last year I visited an art gallery with
                        a few friends, this was my first experience at an art gallery so while I looked
                        and marveled at the creativity, I saw pictures that inspired me greatly, there
                        was this one powerful photo that told a story of those who have no voice. Then
                        later on my way back I saw a social media post that read <b>“To serve a cause is to
                            act in ways that are beyond personal concerns and direct personal gains” </b>I immediately
                        recognized the voice of my creator trying to communicate with me through the elements of
                        the universe (his creation), this post has inspired me in so many ways, I have now learned
                        to live and ensure I impact others around me. Sadly, over 89 million people live below the
                        poverty line in Nigeria,
                        so hunger, starvation and malnutrition continues to reign as the population grows and the needs
                        for food-banks are increasing.

                        <br><br>
                        So on my birthday this year, coming up on the 7th August, I am hoping to support a community
                        around
                        me with food relief, to provide food at no cost to families struggling to put food on their
                        table,
                        through my Non-profit organization Ahava Development Initiative <a
                            href="www.ahavadevinit.org">www.ahavadevinit.org</a> I will be starting
                        at my childhood neighborhood to serve at my mother’s food pantry where she provides food to the
                        widows
                        seasonally this is because “charity they say, begins at home”. Now, I feel inadequate because
                        the task is
                        beyond me, I cannot achieve this on my own, so I have involved you, thinking we have a shared
                        goal of making
                        simple impacts as we go about our everyday life.
                        <b>Therefore I am delighted to invite you to participate and partner with me in any of the
                            following ways for
                            this worthwhile cause.</b>
