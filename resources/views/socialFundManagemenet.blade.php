                        management pool for
                        socially conscious investors we operate on a businesslike approach of private equities to
                        operate.
                        We are a credible philanthropic fund manager for donors to help them increase the positive
                        impact of
                        philanthropic giving. Donations are made to help solve the world’s most pressing problems, yet
                        worthy
                        programs often struggle to find funding. Therefore, we are creating a platform to bridge the
                        giving
                        gap to worthy programs between donors and creative initiatives using private equity model, we
                        pride
                        ourselves in giving our partners security, accuracy, trust and expertise. Our approach is to
                        install
                        a monitoring and evaluation staff to the non-profit organization receiving funds to monitor how
                        the
                        funds are dispensed and measure impact. While international Non-profits and well established
                        Civil
                        Society organizations are able to access donor support to engage in impactful projects. This is
                        so
                        for common Non Profits in Nigeria and Africa at large.
