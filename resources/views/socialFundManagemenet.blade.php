Donations are made to help solve the world’s most pressing problems, yet worthy programs often struggle to find funding. So, we operate a fund management pool to connect socially conscious investors to ethical and credible non-profit organisations. We run this program similar to the private equities model.  We are creating a platform to bridge the giving gap to worthy programs between donors and creative initiatives, we pride ourselves in giving our partners security, accuracy, trust and expertise. While we hope that international non-profits and well established civil society organizations are able to access donations from our platform. We also hope that donors will find impactful projects from smaller organisations to invest in. 
Our approach is to install a monitoring and evaluation staff to the non-profit organization receiving funds to monitor how the funds are dispensed and measure the impact of the project. We ensure the project meets both the donor and recipient’s objectives.
