                        sm-width-100"> Our approach to tackling the root causes of socio-economic crimes is three prong. A framework for possibly preventing the total collapse of the social and economic system while also ensuring the flourishing of future generations: First, to shift the human understanding towards the heart of compassion and connection through ideological appeals, developing social infrastructure and a relational concept. Through this methodology, we will relentlessly identify and scale up the systems that promote social cohesion and help us build a common life together. We create and strengthen the social infrastructure of our country to help heal our deeply divided nation.  For too long, this infrastructure has been underinvested in.  We initiate this first process by building a community of interdependent people, through providing basic life essentials to the underprivileged communities and encouraging the public to share with people whose standard of living is below theirs. Our second approach is to reorient mindsets on virtues for peaceful living, promoting moral order and promoting an enhanced participation in productive activities by the youth. Then, we mobilize and connect ethical problem solvers with creative initiatives to social investors through our platform. We believe equipping ethical reorganizers who are passionate about establishing social reforms that will provide solutions to problems within poverty, food insecurity, decline in social values, inequality & crime 
                        <br><br>
                        We understand that social problems are complex and cross cutting, they warrant a collaborative approach to confront them. Hence, our progress will not happen through government or the private sector alone; it will be led by the civil society so we are promoting a participatory approach for the formulation of effective policy frameworks. Aid alone cannot solve the most pressing societal problems hence our current model of paradigm shift away from only philanthropic approach. We approach problem solving through humanitarian and systematic techniques taking into consideration sustainability.
                        <br><br>
                        Our model is to build an interdependent society, mobilize value driven and social investors who are willing to take the risk to fund a new approach to tackling the root causes of socio-economic crimes which we believe to be (poverty, food insecurity, high rates of illiteracy, moral deficit and inequality). We envision a society where citizens, government and philanthropist participate in the promotion of public good and emphasize the primacy of humanity over standards. We continue to strive to bridge the gap between people of all social and financial backgrounds, with a focus on working towards a future without poverty.<br>
                        Our objectives align with the SDG goal 1,10 and 16<br><br>
                        Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere<br>
                        Goal 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries<br>
                        Goal 16 Promote peace, justice and stronger institutions<br>
