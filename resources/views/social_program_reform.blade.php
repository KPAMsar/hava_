                    This program is designed to educate the future generation of peacebuilders. It is a space to transform mindsets. Stimulate civic action toward a culture of peace, compassion and values The conscious development of human resources with moral principles and standards which guide human actions to being good citizens and having dignity of labor through ideological appeals, public education, teaching peace in schools, productivity and efficiency in achievements through corporate culture. 
Our preventive work is to urge restraint and facilitate the de-escalation that paves the way for reconciliation. We are focused on stabilising the situations in conflict-sensitive areas, improving inter-ethnic relations, building trust between the communities, and facilitating access to justice. Focusing on peacebuilding and livelihoods in the hardest hit conflict areas, the programme will reduce tensions and avert further violent incidents in the local communities, strengthening the capacity of local authorities, other civil society organizations, including women organizations, to design social policies and advocate for their communities.
