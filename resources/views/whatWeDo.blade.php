                        sm-width-100">Our approach is three prong: First, to shift the human understanding through
                        ideological appeals towards the heart of
                        compassion and connection, thus developing Interdependency
                        and the heart to share simple acts of love. Through this approach, we provide basic life
                        essetials and encourage
                        the public to share with people whose standard of living is slightly below theirs. Then,
                        to mobilize and connect
                        ethical problem solvers who have creative initiatives to social
                        investors
                        through our platform. Finally, we consciously develop younger minds with national values
                        and
                        peacebuilding principles. Through these techniques and effective campaigns, Ahava involves in
                        civic engagement
                        in
                        collaboration with other non-profit organisations, we together promote participatory

                        approach for the formulation of effective policy frameworks .

                        sm-width-100">We understand that social problems are complex and cross cutting,
                        they warrant a collaborative approach to confront them. It is also our believe
                        that the adoption of moral standards that guide daily human existence is the only
                        way to tackle such challenges.<br> Our model is to build an interdependent society,
                        mobilize
                        value driven and social investors who are willing to take the risk to fund a new approach
                        to tackling poverty and inequality. To equip reorganizers who are passionate about
                        establishing
                        social reforms that will provide solutions to problems within poverty, inequality and national
                        rift.

                        sm-width-100">We envision a society where citizens, government and
                        philanthropist participate in the promotion of public good and emphasize
                        the primacy of humanity over standards.Aid alone cannot solve
                        the most pressing societal problems hence our current model of paradigm
                        shift away from only philanthropic approach to
                        creating value while also receiving generosity. We approach problem solving
                        through humanitarian and businesslike techniques taking
                        into consideration sustainability. We continue to strive to bridge the
                        gap between people of all social and financial backgrounds, with a
                        focus on working towards a future without poverty.<br>our objectives align with

                        sm-width-100">We contribute to improve livelihood of people in Nigeria
                        specifically the rural areas, we influence policy change in favour of
                        the poor and promote peace and call for equal opportunities for the
                        average Nigerian. We understand poverty and violence to be closely
                        interconnected; and that conflict causes and compounds poverty. Our
                        model seeks to reduce inequality to promote inclusive development,
                        educate on peace to
                        reduce the likelihood of conflicts; and correspondingly reduce armed
                        conflicts to eradicate poverty.

                        sm-width-100">Furthermore, the monetary and multidimensional measure of poverty
                        indicates low access to health facilities, education and a lower standard of living.
                        According to the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics “40% or 83 million Nigerians
                        live in poverty” it means they have low access to health facilities, education and
                        their standard of living is low. We seek to secure and restore a prosperous society.
                        Hence, we have moved beyond depending on aid alone to create a more sustainable and
                        practical approach tackling this social challenge. We believe all lives are equal.
                        No one should be discriminated against or live in poverty. Wealth and power should
                        not be concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the poor and marginalized.
                        Our programs are designed to offer direct support to people living in poverty for a
                        better society and additionally sustain their new live by training and promoting their
                        participation in productive activities. We envision a society where everyone has an
                        opportunity to thrive, living a dignified life and equality is within grasp. We also
                        visualize a world where women and girls have an equal opportunity to progress and help
                        their families and communities escape the shackles of poverty so they can enjoy a better
                        and sustained standard of living. Our process expects to influence the reorganization
                        and reorientation of the entire economic and social system in Nigeria and Africa in the long
                        run.
